LevelStory: The Shark must have sensed the submarines\n increase in power and the extra electrical charge\n has made it very aggressive. We've lowered the\n submarines power consumption, but try to avoid\n the Shark long enough for it to calm down. This\n also seems to have affected the fish as they\n are now forming schools with other fish of\n different species
