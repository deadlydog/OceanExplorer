- See if there's a way to have the camera not inherit the players orientation, then just do a check if players orientation == camera's orientation with a tolerance of 30 degrees and it the camera if it isn't - camera could then always be rightside up
- Have a turbo button which allows you to swim faster
- Have a time limit to beat to catch all of the fish

- Look into using that character class in the wiki

- Give speed burst when certain colors are collected

- Have a time limit to try and catch as many enemies as possibl in to get a high score

- Have different submarines to choose from. Small fast ones and big slow ones. Some could maybe have a tractor beam which pulls close enemies in (maybe make this an item)

- Make it so you can only turn sub when moving forward (make the yaw acceleration proportional to the forward acceleration)

- Implement a radar to show where fish are relative to the sub
