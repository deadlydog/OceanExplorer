## History

I developed Ocean Explorer for my CS809 university class in 2007 using C++ and the Ogre3D graphics engine.
Basically you control a submarine and swim around a 3D ocean completing objectives while avoiding the shark.
The fish flock in groups and the shark uses a simple AI where if the shark is hungry it will hunt fish, and if it is full it will hunt your submarine.
There are 5 levels, but I still have to add music and sounds to the game; it is still fully playable though.

I've uploaded the code and assemblies for posterity sake.
Feel free to check out [the source code](src/) ðŸ™‚
However, please don't judge me by it as it was written near the start of my programming career when I still had much to learn ðŸ˜‰
